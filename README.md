## *User Story*

-[ ] [#7] (https://github.com/ushanelluri/AI-Agent-Stock/issues/7) [Title: Multi-Source Sentiment-Driven Stock Prediction and Trading Strategy]

*Story:*  
-[ ] As a trader, I want to integrate sentiment analysis from diverse sources—including financial news, social media, and financial reports—into my stock market prediction model so that I can enhance my investment returns, make better-informed trading decisions, and validate my strategy with forward testing in real or simulated market environments.

---

## *Acceptance Criteria*

1. *Data Coverage & Quality*  
   - Data pipelines collect timely, relevant, and clean data from multiple sources (news articles, social media, financial reports, etc.).  
   - Preprocessing handles missing data, noise, and language nuances (e.g., sarcasm, multilingual content).

2. *Sentiment Analysis Efficacy*  
   - Models (lexicon-based, machine learning, deep learning) accurately capture sentiment signals, including nuanced sentiment (irony, sarcasm).  
   - Achieve predefined performance benchmarks (e.g., minimum sentiment classification accuracy) across diverse data sets.

3. *Predictive Model Integration*  
   - Sentiment features are successfully integrated into the stock prediction model, showing measurable improvement over a baseline (e.g., a specified percentage increase in prediction accuracy or return).

4. *Trading Strategy & Validation*  
   - Trading signals (buy/sell/hold) are generated from sentiment-driven insights, combined with other market indicators.  
   - Strategy is validated through *backtesting, **out-of-sample testing, and **forward testing* (paper trading or live simulation) to ensure robust performance.

5. *Performance Metrics*  
   - Achieve target risk-adjusted returns (e.g., Sharpe ratio above a specified threshold).  
   - Demonstrate controlled drawdowns and consistent results across multiple market conditions.

6. *Documentation & Explainability*  
   - Clear, comprehensive documentation of the data collection process, model architectures, trading strategy rules, and testing procedures.  
   - Model decisions and sentiment-driven signals must be explainable to stakeholders.

---

## *Definition of Done*

- *Data Pipeline Reliability*: All data sources (news, social media, financial filings) are integrated, and data is consistently cleaned, labeled, and stored without major gaps or errors.  
- *Sentiment Model Validation*: The chosen sentiment analysis models meet or exceed predefined accuracy and robustness metrics (e.g., F1-score, AUC).  
- *Predictive Performance*: The integrated model demonstrates improved stock movement predictions relative to a baseline when tested on multiple market scenarios.  
- *Trading Strategy Proof*:  
  1. *Backtest:* A thorough historical backtest shows positive results over baseline strategies.  
  2. *Out-of-Sample Test:* Model maintains performance on data withheld from training (e.g., future periods or different stocks).  
  3. *Forward Test:* Strategy is tested in near-real-time or paper-trading simulation to confirm that performance metrics hold under live conditions.  
- *Risk Management & Metrics*: Documented evidence of acceptable drawdown, risk-adjusted returns, and minimal overfitting.  
- *Complete Documentation*: All project artifacts—code, data handling procedures, model architectures, testing scripts, and final results—are fully documented and shared with stakeholders.
